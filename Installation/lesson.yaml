    Great! Usually, you will load all your packages at the top of your script,
    so that other people who use your script will know at the start which packages
    they must first install. Please make sure that the "Exploratory Data Analysis"
    course is installed. If it is not, please run the following line:

    install_course("Exploratory_Data_Analysis")

    We recommend that you do that course before proceeding to the next lesson in this course ("Extract Data").
    If you have already installed that course, please type "1" to finish this lesson.
